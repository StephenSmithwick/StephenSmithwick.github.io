I am a Senior Software Developer who most recently worked at Snowflake and Amazon S3 with significant experience in cloud computing and machine learning. Prior to this, I was Principal Software Engineer at Qantas Airlines, working on customer solutions such as notifications and insights. I am passionate about my work which mostly involves exploring, innovating and implementing key decisions around our solutions. I believe in the importance of agile development which builds team excellence through the practice of continuous improvement. I also love to code and learn new technologies: from experiments in ML to scripts to scratch an itch, I happily geek out with my team and colleagues.
