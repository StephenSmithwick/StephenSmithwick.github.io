Established the Sydney chapter and ran several hackathons. Worked with charities to define their problems and guided volunteers to ensure that projects were effectively deployed. An example project, FirstStop, was developed in conjunction with the Blue Mountains Bush Fire Crisis team and Sydney University to allow users affected by disaster to share their personal data with aid agencies using a QR code (June 2014).
