#### Kindle fraud and abuse
Built a machine learning (ML) pipeline which used reader behavior to detect fraud in near real-time.
*   Used Kinesis streams to collect batches of live reader behavior for analysis
*   Deployed models trained by ML scientists and hosted in SageMaker BYO ECR containers
*   Built tooling to allow ML scientists to train and deploy models that integrated on a near real-time basis

#### Consistency monitoring and repair
Amazon introduced strongly consistent writes which require significant changes to the underlying architecture.
*   Designed workflow, built software and wrote runbooks for new processes to handle alarming and repair of S3 entries
