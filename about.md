I am a Senior Software Development Engineer with a technical focus currently responsible for designing, implementing, monitoring, scaling and optimizing software services within Amazon.com. I am passionate about my work which involves exploring, innovating and implementing solutions in software and working with stakeholders. 

I also love to code and learn new technologies: from Android Apps for my son in Kotlin to Scala courses and meetups, I happily geek out with my team and colleagues.
