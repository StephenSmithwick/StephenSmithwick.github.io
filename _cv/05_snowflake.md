#### Organizing and Automating Certificate Management
Over time, Snowflake's multiple internal services required managing 1000s of certificates from multiple certificate providers
with automation ranging from fully to not-at-all.  Regular certificate renewals and requisite monitoring became difficult as knowledge of the particulars was lost.
*   Represented Snowflake in technical discussions with major clients when potentially disruptive certificate rotations were needed
*   Worked with multiple internal and external teams operating services for Snowflake to discover and improve the reliability of certificates management
*   Led the development of a centralized tracking system to identify all certificates used by Snowflake using a combination of internal and external data (CT Logs)
