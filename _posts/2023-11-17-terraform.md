[ls-terraform-post]: https://wormholerelays.com/posts/localstack-with-terraform-and-docker-for-running-aws-locally/

Heavily inspired by the [LocalStack Terraform Documentation][ls-terraform] and [WormholeRelays Localstack with Terraform and Docker for running AWS locally][ls-terraform-post]

# Setup

```zsh
# Installing our dependencies

# Docker
brew install docker --cask docker

# Localstack and terraform adapter
brew install localstack 
pip install terraform-local
```
{:.left}

After installing our dependencies it's important to ensure docker daemon is up and configured: 

`open /Applications/Docker.app`

And then we will start LocalStack which runs a mock AWS environment in a docker container: 

`localstack start`

# Initial Terraform Project

{:.file}
main.tf

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "test-bucket" {
  bucket = "my-bucket"
}
```

{:.clear}
```zsh
# Init terraform
tflocal init

# Apply main.tf
tflocal apply
```

```hcl
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:
