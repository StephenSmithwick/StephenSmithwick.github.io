`jq` is a fast, streaming JSON parser accessible from the command line, capable of reading and transforming well-formatted JSON. Below are some references of actions you can do with `jq`:

1.  **Exploring JSON data of any size.** For large files, `jq` is often the fastest way to view the data. Use `jq -C` to output with ANSI color codes and `less -R` to properly display them.
    ```zsh
    curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
    | jq -C | less -R
    ```
2.  **Isolating specific elements within repeating structures.** Use `jq -r` to output raw results.
    -   `.` refers to the top level of the JSON object.
    -   `[]` addresses each object in an array individually.
    -   `.FIELD_SELECTOR` selects a specific field.
    ```zsh
    curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
    | jq -r '.[].type' \
    | sort | uniq
    ```
3.  **Selecting results based on conditions.**
    -   `|` pipes results to the next step, similar to Unix pipes.
    -   `select(BOOLEAN_EXPRESSION)` applies a boolean expression to each element and retains only those that evaluate to `true`.
    ```zsh
    curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
    | jq '.[]
          | select(.type == "PushEvent")
          | .payload.commits[].message'
    ```
4.  **Mapping and formatting results.**
    -   `| [.FIELD_SELECTOR1, .FIELD_SELECTOR2]` creates an array with the results of each selector.
    -   `| @tsv` formats the output as a tab-separated table (other formats include `@csv`, `@json`, `@uri`, `@base64`).
    ```zsh
    curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
    | jq -r '.[]
          | select(.type == "PushEvent")
          | .payload.commits[]
          | [.author.email, .sha, .message]
          | @tsv'
    ```
5.  **Performing string interpolation.**
    ```zsh
    curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
    | jq -r '.[]
        | "\(.actor.display_login) - \(.type) on repo:\(.repo.name) at date:\(.created_at)"
    '
    ```
