`jq` is a fast streaming json parser accessible from the command line which can read and transform well formatted json.  I find it useful to:

1. Explore json data of any size. For large files jq is often the fastest way to view the data. Use `jq -C` to output with ANSI color code and `less -R` to accept them.
```zsh
curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
| jq -C | less -R
```
2. Isolate a particular part of repeating elements. Use `jq -r` to output the raw results.
`.` is the top level of the json object.
`[]` starts addressing each object in the array individually.
`.FIELD_SELECTOR` selects a field.
```zsh
curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
| jq -r '.[].type' \
| sort | uniq
```
3. Select results.
`|` pipes results to the next step like unix pipes.
`select(BOOLEAN_EXPRESSION)` applies the boolean expression to each element and keeps `true` results
```zsh
curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
| jq '.[]
      | select(.type == "PushEvent")
      | .payload.commits[].message'
```
4. Map results.
`| [.FIELD_SELECTOR1, .FIELD_SELECTOR2]` creates an array with the results of each selector
`| @tsv` formats output as a tab seperated table (See also `@csv`, `@json`, `@uri`, `@base64`)
```zsh
curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
| jq -r '.[]
      | select(.type == "PushEvent")
      | .payload.commits[]
      | [.author.email, .sha, .message]
      | @tsv'
```
5. String interpolation
```zsh
curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
| jq -r '.[]
    | "\(.actor.display_login) - \(.type) on repo:\(.repo.name) at date:\(.created_at)"
'
```
