`jq` is a fast, streaming JSON parser accessible from the command line, capable of reading and transforming well-formatted JSON. Below are some references of actions you can do with `jq`:

**Streaming Large Data**
: \
```zsh
node <<< "for(let i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) console.log(JSON.stringify({ i, r: Math.random()}))" \
| jq -C | less -R
```
For large files, `jq` is often the fastest way to view the data \
Use `jq -C` to output with ANSI color codes and `less -R` to properly display them. 


**Extract From List**
: \
```zsh
curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
| jq -r '.[].type' \
| sort | uniq
```
: Use `jq -r` to output raw results.
- `.` refers to the top level of the JSON object.
-   `[]` addresses each object in an array individually.
-   `.FIELD_SELECTOR` selects a specific field.


**Select From Array**
: \
```zsh
curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
| jq '.[]
    | select(.type == "PushEvent")
    | .payload.commits[].message'
```
- `select(BOOLEAN_EXPRESSION)` applies a boolean expression to each element and retains only those that evaluate to `true`.
- `|` pipes results to the next step, similar to Unix pipes.

**Map and format**
: \
```zsh
curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
| jq -r '.[]
      | select(.type == "PushEvent")
      | .payload.commits[]
      | [.author.email, .sha, .message]
      | @tsv'
```
-   `| [.FIELD_SELECTOR1, .FIELD_SELECTOR2]` creates an array with the results of each selector.
-   `| @tsv` formats the output as a tab-separated table (other formats include `@csv`, `@json`, `@uri`, `@base64`).

  
**String Interpolation**
: \
```zsh
curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
| jq -r '.[]
    | "\(.actor.display_login) - \(.type) on repo:\(.repo.name) at date:\(.created_at)"
'
```

**Map Objects**
: \
```zsh
curl -s https://api.github.com/events \
| jq '.[] | to_entries | map([.key, .value])'
```
- `to_entries` - iterates through all object fields
- `| map` - create a new object using, `.key` is the field name, `.value` is it's value
