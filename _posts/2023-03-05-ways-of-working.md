Below I have included the agile manifesto and principals verbatim because I think it's important to center the manifesto when discussing processes such as Scrum and Kanban.

# Agile Manifesto
> We are uncovering better ways of developing  
> software by doing it and helping others do it.  
> Through this work we have come to value:  
>  
> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
> Working software over comprehensive documentation  
> Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
>  
> Responding to change over following a plan  
> That is, while there is value in the items on  
> the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Principles
> We follow these principles:
>
> 1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
> through early and continuous delivery
> of valuable software.
> 2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in
> development. Agile processes harness change for
> the customer's competitive advantage.
> 3. Deliver working software frequently, from a
> couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
> preference to the shorter timescale.
> 4. Business people and developers must work
> together daily throughout the project.
> 5. Build projects around motivated individuals.
> Give them the environment and support they need,
> and trust them to get the job done.
> 6. The most efficient and effective method of
> conveying information to and within a development
> team is face-to-face conversation.
> 7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
> 8. Agile processes promote sustainable development.
> The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
> to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
> 9. Continuous attention to technical excellence
> and good design enhances agility.
> 10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
> of work not done--is essential.
> 11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs
> emerge from self-organizing teams.
> 12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
> to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
> its behavior accordingly.

# Agile is Dead
[Agile is Dead • Pragmatic Dave Thomas • GOTO 2015](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M&t=8s)

Agile has evolved into a proper noun. Consultants often promote a form of cargo cult, where the focus shifts from the underlying values to rigid processes. The most crucial aspect of the Agile Manifesto lies in its values; processes, while important, exist to support these values. Ultimately, agile development should prioritize people over process.
