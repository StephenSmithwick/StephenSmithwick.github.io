This is an exploration of a [DeepSeek R1][DeepSeek-R1] distilled model: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B.

DeepSeek-R1 is a large-scale model trained with reinforcement learning and without supervised fine-tuning.
Supervised fine-tuning adapts a pre-trained Large Language Model to a task using labeled data as final step.
Reinforcement learning does not require precise labels but simply a reward for eventual correct behviour.


# Running Locally
I have used the convenient ollama tool to fetch and run the model.
```zsh
brew install ollama
ollama serve
ollama run deepseek-r1:14b
```
Please note that despite the text ollama is downloading a distilled qwen (general.name=DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 14B)

The answer is uninteresting in that it is correct.  The \<think\> block is more interesting and if taken at face value
starts with the correct answer but needs to recall other related facts before deciding the initial answer is correct.

> Certainly! Below is an example of a Rust program that calculates the value of Pi (π) out to a specified number of digits. This program uses the
> Monte Carlo method, which is a statistical simulation approach. While it's not the most efficient algorithm for calculating π, it's relatively

>
> ### Steps:
> 1. **Import Dependencies**: We'll need the `rand` crate for generating random numbers.
> 2. **Define Constants**: Set up constants like the number of iterations and the specified precision.
> 3. **Calculate Pi Using Monte Carlo Method**:
>   - Generate random points within a unit square.
>   - Count how many points fall inside the unit circle.
>   - Use the ratio to estimate π.
> 4. **Output the Result**: Print the calculated value of π with the specified number of digits.
>
> ### Rust Code:
>
> ```rust
> use rand::Rng;
>
> fn main() {
>     // Number of random points to generate (more = better approximation)
>     let num_points: u32 = 10_000_000; // You can adjust this for more precision
>
>     // Calculate Pi using Monte Carlo method
>     let mut count_inside_circle = 0;
>     let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
>
>     for _ in 0..num_points {
>         let x: f64 = rng.gen_range(0.0, 1.0);
>         let y: f64 = rng.gen_range(0.0, 1.0);
>
>         if (x * x + y * y) < 1.0 {
>             count_inside_circle += 1;
>         }
>     }
>
>     // Calculate Pi
>     let pi_estimate = 4.0 * (count_inside_circle as f64) / (num_points as f64);
>
>     // Print Pi with the specified number of digits
>     println!("Estimate of Pi: {:.10}", pi_estimate);
> }
> ```
>
> ### Explanation:
> - **Monte Carlo Method**: This method approximates π by simulating random points within a square and checking if they fall inside the inscribed
> circle. The ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points (multiplied by 4) gives an estimate of π.
> - **Precision**: The accuracy of this method depends on the number of iterations (`num_points`). More points will result in a more accurate
> approximation but will also take longer to compute.
> - **Output**: The program prints the estimated value of π with up to 10 decimal places. You can adjust the format string to show more or fewer
> digits.
>
> ### Running the Program:
> To run this program, you'll need:
> 1. Rust installed on your system.
> 2. The `rand` crate added as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file.
>
> You can compile and run it using:
> ```bash
> cargo run
> ```
>
> If you want more precision, you might consider using more advanced algorithms like the **Chudnovsky algorithm** or leveraging existing libraries
> for high-precision calculations. Let me know if you'd like to see an implementation of a different method!

The code, as written, required minimal changes to make compilable, likely due to updates to the assumed library (see below).
More concerning is the fact the this program does not meet requirements:

> Alright, so I have this logic puzzle here with five houses in a row, each painted a different color: red, green, yellow, blue, and white. Each house has a person of a different
> nationality living in it—Brit, Swede, Dane, German, and Norwegian. Each person also drinks a different beverage (tea, coffee, milk, beer, water), smokes a different type of cigar (Pall
> Mall, Dunhill, Blends, BlueMaster, Prince), and owns a different pet (dog, bird, horse, cat, fish).
>
> The goal is to figure out which person owns the pet fish. There are 15 clues provided to solve this puzzle. Let me try to break this down step by step.
>
> First, I'll list out all the categories:
>
> - **House Colors**: Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, White
> - **Nationalities**: Brit, Swede, Dane, German, Norwegian
> - **Beverages**: Tea, Coffee, Milk, Beer, Water
> - **Cigars**: Pall Mall, Dunhill, Blends, BlueMaster, Prince
> - **Pets**: Dog, Bird, Horse, Cat, Fish
>
> Each category has five unique items, and each house corresponds to one of each item. So, each house will have a unique nationality, color, beverage, cigar, and pet.
>
> Now, let's list out the clues:
>
> 1. The Brit lives in the red house.
> 2. The Swede has a pet dog.
> 3. The Dane drinks tea.
> 4. The green house is directly to the left of the white house.
> 5. The person in the green house drinks coffee.
> 6. The person who smokes Pall Mall has a pet bird.
> 7. The person in the yellow house smokes Dunhill cigars.
> 8. The person in the center house drinks milk.
> 9. The Norwegian lives in the first house.
> 10. The person who smokes Blends lives next to the person with the pet cat.
> 11. The person with the pet horse lives next to the one who smokes Dunhill.
> 12. The person who smokes BlueMaster drinks beer.
> 13. The German smokes Prince.
> 14. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
> 15. The person who smokes Blends has a neighbor who drinks water.
>
> Okay, that's a lot to process. Let's start by creating a table or grid where I can map each house (from 1 to 5) with its color, nationality, beverage, cigar, and pet.
>
> I'll number the houses from left to right as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
>
> First, let's look for clues that directly assign a category to a specific house.
>
> From clue 9: The Norwegian lives in the first house (house 1).
>
> From clue 4: The green house is directly to the left of the white house. Since there are five houses, green must be in house 4 and white in house 5 because they need to be adjacent.
>
> Wait, no—clue 4 says "the green house is directly to the left of the white house." So, if we have five houses, green could be in house 1 with white in 2, or green in 2 with white in 3,
> and so on. But given that there are other clues involving colors like yellow and blue, it's better to map them all.
>
> From clue 7: The person in the yellow house smokes Dunhill cigars.
>
> From clue 14: The Norwegian lives next to the blue house. Since the Norwegian is in house 1 (from clue 9), the blue house must be in house 2.
>
> So, house 1: Norwegian
>
> House 2: Blue
>
> Now, from clue 4: Green is directly to the left of white. So, if green is in house 3, then white would be in house 4? But we need to adjust based on other clues.
>
> Wait, let's try to map colors first since that seems doable.
>
> From clue 4: Green is directly to the left of white. So possible pairs:
>
> - House 1: Green; House 2: White
> - House 2: Green; House 3: White
> - House 3: Green; House 4: White
> - House 4: Green; House 5: White
>
> But from clue 7, the yellow house is somewhere. Let's see.
>
> From clue 1: The Brit lives in the red house.
>
> So, red is assigned to the Brit.
>
> We have colors: Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, White.
>
> From clue 9 and 14:
>
> House 1: Norwegian
>
> From clue 14, next to blue. So if House 1 is Norwegian, then House 2 must be blue (clue 14).
>
> So:
>
> House 1: Norwegian; possibly color yellow? Because from clue 7, the person in the yellow house smokes Dunhill.
>
> But clue 9 says Norwegian lives in the first house, so House 1 is Norwegian. Let's not assume anything else yet.
>
> From clue 4: Green directly left of white. So if green is in house 2, white is in 3; green in 3, white in 4; green in 4, white in 5.
>
> But let's see other clues to find exact positions.
>
> Clue 8: The person in the center house drinks milk. Center house is house 3.
>
> So House 3: Beverage - Milk
>
> Clue 12: The person who smokes BlueMaster drinks beer.
>
> Clue 15: The person who smokes Blends has a neighbor who drinks water.
>
> Clue 6: Person who smokes Pall Mall has pet bird.
>
> Clue 10: Smoker of Blends lives next to person with pet cat.
>
> Clue 11: Pet horse lives next to smoker of Dunhill.
>
> Clue 5: Green house drinks coffee.
>
> Okay, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to map the colors first.
>
> We know:
>
> House 1: Norwegian
>
> From clue 14: House 2 is blue.
>
> So, House 1: Color?
>
> Wait, we have five colors: Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, White.
>
> From clue 1: Brit lives in red house.
>
> But where is the red house? It could be any of the houses. However, from clue 4 and others, let's see.
>
> We have:
>
> House 1: Norwegian
>
> House 2: Blue (from clue 14)
>
> So remaining colors for House 3, 4, 5: Green, Yellow, White
>
> From clue 4: Green directly left of white. So if green is in house 3, white in 4; green in 4, white in 5.
>
> Let's assume green is in house 4 and white in house 5.
>
> So:
>
> House 1: Norwegian, color?
>
> House 2: Blue
>
> House 3: ?
>
> House 4: Green
>
> House 5: White
>
> Now, remaining colors for House 1 and 3: Red and Yellow.
>
> From clue 7: The person in the yellow house smokes Dunhill. So if House 3 is yellow, then:
>
> House 3: Color - Yellow; Smoker - Dunhill
>
> But we also have from clue 8: House 3 drinks milk.
>
> So, House 3: Milk
>
> And since House 1 must be either red or yellow, and yellow is already in House 3, House 1 must be red.
>
> Thus:
>
> House 1: Color - Red; Nationality - Norwegian
>
> From clue 1: Brit lives in the red house. But wait, that's House 1. So, the Norwegian is also the Brit? That can't be because nationalities are unique.
>
> Wait a minute, this suggests that my assumption is wrong. If House 1 is both red and Norwegian, but the Brit must live in the red house, then the person in House 1 would have to be

> Therefore, my initial assumption must be incorrect. Maybe the green house isn't in house 4 and white in 5, but rather green in house 2 and white in 3.
>
> Let me try that.
>
> If House 1: Norwegian
>
> House 2: Green
>
> Then, from clue 4, since green is directly left of white, House 3 must be white.
>
> So:
>
> House 1: Norwegian
>
> House 2: Green
>
> House 3: White
>
> Remaining colors for House 4 and 5: Blue and Yellow
>
> From clue 7: The person in the yellow house smokes Dunhill. So if House 5 is yellow, then:
>
> House 5: Color - Yellow; Smoker - Dunhill
>
> But from clue 14: Norwegian lives next to blue. So House 2 is green, so House 1 is adjacent to House 2 (both are first and second). But clue 14 says Norwegian is in the first house, next

>
> Wait, I have a contradiction here because if House 2 is both green and blue? That's impossible. So my earlier assumption was wrong.

> So:

> House 2: ?

> House1: Nationality - Norwegian; Color needs to be assigned

> We have to assign color to House1 such that all colors are unique and satisfy other clues.

> Thus:
>
> House1: Norwegian
>
> House2: Blue
>
> Now assign colors:

> Clue1: Brit in red. So somewhere (House3,4,5) is red.

> Clue7: The yellow house smokes Dunhill.
>
> So if we can assign color to Houses 3,4,5 as Red, Green, Yellow, White.
>
> Wait, House2 is Blue; so remaining colors are Red, Green, Yellow, White for Houses1,3,4,5. But House1 cannot be blue or red? Wait no:

> But let's proceed.
>
> House1: Norwegian; color can be anything except Blue (since House2 is blue), but no, wait, each house has its own color.
>
> So:
>
> House1: Nationality - Norwegian; Color ?
>
> Let me think step by step.
>
> Since House2 is Blue, House1 can't be Blue. So possible colors for House1: Red, Green, Yellow, White

>
> House2: G - Coffee
>

>
> - House3: W
>
> - House4: B
>

>
> Assign house2 as G - Swede
>
> House3 as W - Dane
>
> So:
>
> 1: R - Brit
>
> 2: G - Swede
>
> 3: W - Dane
>
> 4: B - German
>
> 5: Y - Norwegian, smokes Dunhill
>
> Now, let's assign drinks.
>
> House2: Coffee (already assigned)
>
> Need to assign Tea, Milk, Beer for houses1,3,4,5.
>
> Wait no, house1 needs a drink. Let's see:
>
> Possible drinks: Tea, Coffee, Milk, Beer, Water.
>
> Coffee is in house2.
>
> So, let's assign:
>
> house1: R - Brit; what drink? Maybe Tea.
>
> house3: W - Dane; perhaps Beer.
>
> house4: B - German; maybe Milk.
>
> house5: Y - Norwegian; possibly Water.
>
> But we have to ensure each drink is unique.

> Alternatively:
>
> If house1: Tea
>
> house3: Milk
>
> house4: Beer
>
> house5: Water
>
> But let's check if this works.
>
> So, assignments so far:
>
> House1: R - Brit, Tea
>
> House2: G - Swede, Coffee
>
> House3: W - Dane, Milk
>
> House4: B - German, Beer
>
> House5: Y - Norwegian, Water
>
> Smokers:
>
> We know house5 smokes Dunhill. Let's assign other smokers.

> 4: Blue - German - Beer
>
> 5: Yellow - Norwegian - Water
>
> Smokers:

I am impressed with the overall steps that the model took to arrive at a solution, however it did not answer the complete question:
