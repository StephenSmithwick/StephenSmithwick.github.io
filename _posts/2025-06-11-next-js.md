This is a quick exploration of Next.js.  I haven't explored react for a few years and am not familiar with Next.js so the goal will be to catch up on Next.js, move beyond the getting started and maybe next post do a more deep dive.


## Getting Started

I recommend going through the Next.js provided [React](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app) foundation courses. Additionally I recommend you check out [React Documentation][react-docs]

### Create your app `npx create-next-app@latest`
To get started we will create our app `nextjs-dashboard`
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard \
--example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example" \
--use-pnpm
cd nextjs-dashboard
```

`--use-pnpm`
: pnpm is a faster package manager.  Install using `npm install -g pnpm`

`--example`
: Start your project with a specified directory in a repo

This will create an app with the following structure:


  /app
  : Contains all the routes, components, and logic for your application.

  /app/lib
  : Contains shared utility and data fetching functions used in your application.

  /app/ui
  : Contains all the UI components for your application. Examples: cards, tables, and forms.

  /public
  : Contains the static assets for your application like images.

### Starting the dev server
1. Install dependencies `pnpm install`
2. Start server: `pnpm dev`

### Tailwind Styling
We will use Tailwind to apply styles ([docs][tailwind-docs]).  Tailwind based apps use many single-purpose [utility classes][tailwind-utility-classes] directly in their markup.  Similar to inline styles, changes are more easily isolated to the module you are applying a change. Unlike inline styles, you can still easily target css states (`:hover`, `:focus`, etc) and easily come up with a responsive website using media queries.

### Setup PostgreSQL

Install and run PostgreSQL:
```bash
brew install postgresql
brew services run postgresql
```
(note: `run` postgresql will not continue running after restart. Use start)

Create a database
```bash
psql postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE next_dashboard;"
psql postgres -c "CREATE USER next WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '${password}';"
psql postgres -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE next_dashboard TO next;"
"
```
