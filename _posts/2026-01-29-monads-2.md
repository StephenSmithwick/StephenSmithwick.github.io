Let's dig into this famous quote:

> A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem?

## Functor
`A<X>.map(t : X -> Y) : A<Y>`
Example: **Collections**, **Sequences**, **Streams** and **Optional**


```nomnoml
#.blue: fill=#cde

[Integer | [Integer] doubleValue -> [Double] toString -> [String] ]
[<blue> Optional<Type> | [Optional<Integer>] map(Integer::doubleValue) ->[Optional<Double>] map(Double::toString) ->[Optional<String>] ]
```
{:.right"}

A transformation that maps objects of a category into objects of another category, preserving structure while containing an object. It is composable and does not change with the identity function. Typically, a functor can be said to contain another class. Classic examples are the java Stream and Optional classes. In Kotlin and most functional languages Collection classes are Monads. An example in Java is Optional which allows the contained value to be modified via the `::map` function.

### Endofunctors
Endofunctors are functors from a category to itself.  In most programming languges this is usually all functors since they're mostly dealing with just one category; the category of types.

Take this example inspired by Rust Results:
{: style="clear: both"}

```kotlin
interface Result<T> {
    fun <V> map(transform: (T) -> V) : Result<V>
}

data class Ok<T> (val value : T) : Result<T> {
    override fun <V> map(transform : (T) -> V) = Ok(transform(value))
}

fun main() {
    println( Ok(1).map { it + 3.0 }.map { "$it!!!" } )
}
```

A `Result` contains a `value`.  The `::map` method makes it a functor because the Result class map mirrors the internal structure

## Monoid

A monoid is an `identity` element paired with a semigroup which combines values in some way `combine : (A,A) -> A`. Take for example the `SumMonoid`:

```kotlin
import java.util.stream.Stream

object SumMonoid {
    fun combine(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b
    val identity = 0
}

fun main() {
    SumMonoid.apply {
        println("Look at the SumMonoid Object: ${combine(1,2)}")
        println("- The semigroup is associative: ${combine(1, combine(2,3))} = ${combine(combine(1,2), 3)}")
        println("- The monoid has an identity element: ${combine(1, identity)}")
        println("- Can combine any order: ${Stream.of(1,2,3,4,5).parallel().reduce(identity, ::combine)}")
    }
}
```


## Monad

A monad is a Functor which can flatten. Often this is a method such as: `::flatMap` or `::bind`.  This allows us to combine with another Monad without increasing the depth of the contained class.

```kotlin
interface Result<T> {
    fun <V> map(transform: (T) -> V) : Result<V>
    fun <V> flatMap(transform: (T) -> Result<V>) : Result<V>
}

data class Ok<T> (val value : T) : Result<T> {
    override fun <V> map(transform : (T) -> V) = Ok(transform(value)) 
    override fun <V> flatMap(transform: (T) -> Result<V>) = transform(value) 
}

fun foo(x: Int) = Ok(x + 2)
fun bar(x: Int) = Ok(x * 3)

fun main() {
    println(foo(1).flatMap(::bar))
}
```
