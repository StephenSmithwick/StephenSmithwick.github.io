I have an idea for an app called Lenshift, designed to help users deeply analyze online or real-world information by revealing hidden biases, funding sources, authorship (including AI-generated content), missing facts, and propaganda techniques. The app acts like a set of analytical tools or “lenses” that let users view the truth from multiple angles.

The focus will be to give easy to use tools to users that they can use to inform themselves of their news sources and help vet this information and help them know what they are missing.

## Lenses
Funding
: Who is paying for this news source?

Origin
: Is this article from independent research, another newspaper, the AP, a press release, or a paid advertisement?

Missing Facts
: Looking for this article elsewhere online does it exclued key facts found in other articles?

Bias
: What are the known biases of the source and author? Are there other key auxiliary facts that will help inform readers of potential propaganda

Generate by AI
: Are there any clues that this article/tweat is written by AI?
