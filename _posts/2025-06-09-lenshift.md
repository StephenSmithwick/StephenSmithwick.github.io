Iâ€™m working on an idea I'm calling **Lenshift**, a tool designed to help users deeply analyze both online and real-world information through a collection of lenses which reveal hidden biases, funding sources, authorship details(including AI-generated content), missing facts, and propaganda techniques.

The goal is to provide **easy-to-use tools** that empower users to better understand their news sources and vet the information they consume.

## Lenses

**Funding**
: Who is paying for this news source?

**Origin**
: Did this story originate from independent research, another news outlet, a wire service like the AP, a press release, or a paid advertisement?

**Missing Facts**
: Are important details or perspectives left out? How does this article compare to others covering the same topic?

**Bias**
: What are the known biases of the publication or author? Are there contextual clues that suggest propaganda or framing techniques?

**Generated by AI**
: Are there indicators that this article or post was written by an AI?
